## Mutations made on test instances (all disposable, all deleted)

- Installed/reinstalled the app zip via `POST /api/apps` (several times per instance as fixes landed).
- App initialisation created: user group "DQ - DQ Config Admin", 1 data element group, 1 indicator group, 4 predictor groups, `dqConfig` dataStore namespace.
- Repeated configure/import/delete cycles for the test data element; orphaned metadata from bug reproduction was cleaned via `POST /api/metadata?importStrategy=DELETE` between runs.
- One scratch data element (`ZZ dryrun test DE`) created and deleted while proving the DHIS2 `dryRun=true` DELETE bug.

## Repository / working tree changes

- Full migration of the app from vanilla-JS/webpack to the DHIS2 App Platform (see review findings). Old `src/`, `webpack.config.js`, `manifest.webapp`, `yarn.lock`, `d2auth*.json` removed; new TypeScript sources under `src/`, platform config at repo root.
- `docs/user-manual.md`: deletion-safety-check section updated (four checks → three; dry-run removed; app-edit exemption documented).
- New e2e suite at `tests/e2e/lifecycle.sh` (parameterized by `DHIS2_URL`).
- Review reports in `docs/review-2026-07-15-platform-migration/`.
- **Nothing committed** — all changes are in the working tree on branch `platfor-migration-review`.

## Not reverted / left behind

- None on any surviving system. All `agent-dq-*` instances deleted; no changes made to non-disposable systems.
