# Data Quality Configuration Helper Tool

> **WARNING**
> This tool is intended to be used by system administrators to perform specific tasks, it is not intended for end users. It is available as a DHIS2 app, but has not been through the same rigorous testing as normal core apps. It should be used with care, and always tested in a development environment.

**Note**: this tool is in a prototype stage, and should be used with care in test/development systems only.

The Data Quality Configuration Helper Tool is designed to streamline the configuration and management of data quality settings within DHIS2. It provides users with easy-to-use interfaces for managing validation rules, indicators, and data integrity checks, aimed at enhancing the reliability and accuracy of data in health information systems.

The app is built on the [DHIS2 App Platform](https://developers.dhis2.org/docs/app-platform/getting-started/) (React, `@dhis2/ui`, `@dhis2/app-runtime`) and supports DHIS2 2.41 and later.
